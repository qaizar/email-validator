# email-validator

## Syntax
The format of an email address is local-part@domain, where the local part may be up to 64 octets long and the domain may have a maximum of 255 octets.[4] The formal definitions are in RFC 5322 (sections 3.2.3 and 3.4.1) and RFC 5321â€”with a more readable form given in the informational RFC 3696[b] and the associated errata.

An email address also may have an associated display name for the recipient, which precedes the address specification, now surrounded by angled brackets, for example: John Smith <john.smith@example.org>.

## Local-part
uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z
digits 0 to 9
printable characters !#$%&'*+-/=?^_`{|}~
dot ., provided that it is not the first or last character and provided also that it does not appear consecutively (e.g., John..Doe@example.com is not allowed).[5]
